# Module 3: TypeScript, Frontend, and Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive coverage of TypeScript, frontend development, and object-oriented programming principles. By the end of this module, you will have a strong foundation in TypeScript and be able to build robust frontend applications.

## Key Topics
1. **Introduction to TypeScript with CLI Tools and Git**
2. **TypeScript Basics: Types, Variables, Functions, and Interfaces**
3. **Advanced TypeScript: Arrays, Tuples, Enums, Classes, Constructors, Modules, and Namespaces**
4. **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Accessors**
5. **Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Advanced Types**
6. **Frontend Development with TypeScript: React Components, Hooks, State Management**
7. **Next.js: Setup, API Routes, Data Fetching, and Styling**

## Final Project
### Title: Social Network Management System
**Description**: This project aims to develop a web application using Next.js and TypeScript where users can manage profiles, set status messages, add friends, and view a personalized feed of status updates. The project will emphasize local state management and responsive UI design.

```

## Exercises and Submissions
Each day includes an exercise file, a morning code folder, and an afternoon code/solution folder.

### How to Access Exercises
1. Navigate to the appropriate `weekX/dayY` directory.
2. Open the `exercise.md` file to view the instructions.

### Morning Code
1. Navigate to the appropriate `weekX/dayY/morning-code` directory.
2. Work on the morning code tasks as specified.

### Afternoon Code and Solutions
1. Navigate to the appropriate `weekX/dayY/afternoon-code` directory.
2. Work on the afternoon code tasks as specified.
3. Solutions can be found in the `solution.md` file after you have attempted the exercise.

## Submission Process

### Step 1: Create a Personal Repository
1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account (e.g., `bootcamp-exercises`).
2. Clone the new repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/bootcamp-exercises.git
   ```
   Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 2: Create Directories for Your Submissions
1. Inside your local repository, create directories for each module, week, and day. For example:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p module-3/week1/day1
   mkdir -p module-3/week1/day2
   mkdir -p module-3/week2/day1
   mkdir -p module-3/week2/day2
   ```

### Step 3: Add Exercise Files
1. For each day, create an `exercise.md` file in the appropriate directory.
2. Add your exercise solutions and any other necessary files.

### Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes
1. Stage your changes for commit:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add exercise solutions for Module 3"
   ```
3. Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
